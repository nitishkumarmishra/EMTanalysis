# EMTanalysis
Code for RNAseq and Riboseq data analysis for EMT data for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Most of the codes are in the form of JupyterLab notebooks.
I have codes for differential expression, GSEA analysis, and starburst and volcano plots of GSEA output data.

Currentely I am working on this project. So these codes are still not finalized. Once I make changes I will upload latest one.
